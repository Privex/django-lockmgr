"""
This module contains test cases for Privex's Django Lock Manager (django-lockmgr).


Testing pre-requisites
----------------------

    - Install all core and development requirements listed in requirements.txt
    - Either PostgreSQL or MySQL is recommended, however the default SQLite3 may or may not work.
    - Python 3.7 or 3.8 is recommended at the time of writing this. See README.md in-case this has changed.


.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

If you're using MySQL / Postgres, create a ``.env`` file in the root of the project, and enter the database
connection details::

    # If not specified, DB_USER and DB_NAME both default to 'lockmgr'
    DB_USER=root
    DB_NAME=lockmgr
    # If not specified, then the DB user password defaults to blank
    DB_PASS=
    # If not specified, the DB host defaults to localhost, and the port as blank (automatic depending on backend)
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    # If not specified, the DB backend defaults to SQLite3 (stored in db.sqlite3 in root of project)
    # If you're using PostgreSQL:
    DB_BACKEND=postgresql
    # If you're using MySQL / MariaDB:
    DB_BACKEND=mysql


Running the tests via Django Test Runner / Django-Nose
------------------------------------------------------

After installing the packages listed in ``requirements.txt``, you should now be able to run the tests using
Django's manage.py::


    # Ensure you have all development requirements installed
    user@host: ~/django-lockmgr $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Then run the tests using manage.py
    user@host: ~/django-lockmgr $ ./manage.py test
    
    nosetests --verbosity=1

For more verbosity, simply add ``--verbose`` to the end of the command::
